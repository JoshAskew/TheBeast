      <h3>Cody Fries</h3>
      <h4>Teams: 2015, 2016</h4>
      <p class="cody">Cody is a dedicated hockey enthusiast with over 30 years of experience as a goalie and more than
        10 years of experience in goalie coaching and teaching hockey. Having grown up in Wisconsin, he played hockey
        through varsity and has continued his passion by supporting the sport through his two kids in the Farmington
        Youth Hockey Association. His journey from player to coach has been driven by a love for the game and a
        commitment to developing young talent.</p>

      <h3>Ian Bing</h3>
      <h4>Teams: 2014, 2015</h4>
      <p class="ian">Ian has been dedicated to coaching hockey since 2012. He began his coaching journey with the Apple
        Valley Youth Association Batam A team from 2012 to 2016. Since then, he has continued his coaching career with
        the Farmington Association at the pony and mite levels, where he currently coaches. Ian is also deeply involved
        with Beast Hockey, serving as a co-program director and coaching both the 2014 and 2015 Beast teams.

        His passion for hockey extends beyond the game itself; he strives to develop not only skilled players but also
        exceptional teammates and individuals. Ian’s commitment to fostering a lifelong love for the sport is evident in
        his coaching approach.

        Ian’s own hockey journey started in Cannon Falls, where he played for Farmington Youth and High School,
        graduating in 2003. He then pursued his playing career at Augsburg University (NCAA Division III), graduating in
        2007.</p>

      <h3>Chad Urdahl</h3>
      <h4>Teams: 2015</h4>
      <p class="chad">Chad is a native of Litchfield, where his hockey career began and advanced through high school,
        three junior seasons, the Div. III college level, and countless men’s leagues. He has coached hockey as a youth
        assistant and at summer camps, along with conducting private skating lessons in the past. In recent years, he
        has coached his son and his peers in the FYHA system and joined the Beast in 2024. He is a firm believer in the
        value of hard work, discipline, and attention to detail on the ice—while also having fun. These positive traits
        are central to his coaching style with the Beast as they help their players develop skills, stretch their
        boundaries, and learn to be good teammates—on and off the ice.</p>

      <h3>Brent Johnson</h3>
      <h4>Teams: 2016</h4>
      <p class="brent">Brent is a former hockey player who lettered three years at Richfield High School and has been
        involved in the sport ever since. For the past 16 years, he has been a high school hockey referee and has spent
        over three years coaching hockey, in addition to more than five years coaching other sports. His passion lies in
        fostering both individual and team growth. He is also a proud parent, with a son in Mites and a daughter
        starting her journey in ponies with Farmington.</p>

      <h3>Scott Mack</h3>
      <h4>Teams: 2016</h4>
      <p class="scott">Scott hails from East Grand Forks, MN, where he was a four-year letter winner for the Green Wave.
        In his senior year, he helped lead the team to their first Section 8 championship since 1982 and a fifth-place
        finish at the Minnesota State Hockey Tournament. After high school, he continued his hockey career by playing
        junior hockey for the Butte Irish of the American Western Hockey League and college hockey at the University of
        Minnesota-Crookston in the Midwest Collegiate Hockey Association. He has been a coach for the past two years and
        is the proud parent of two boys who are part of the Farmington Youth Hockey Association. He aims to bring his
        experience and passion for the game to the next generation of players.</p>

      <h3>Josh Askew</h3>
      <h4>Teams: 2014</h4>
      <p class="josh">Josh has been passionate about hockey since he first hit the ice at the age of 5. He grew up
        playing in the Rosemount Hockey Association and later played for Rosemount High School. In 2006, he joined the
        Inver Grove Heights Junior Gold Team and won the state championship. His love for the game continued into his
        collegiate career during his two years playing at North Dakota State University (NDSU).

        Hockey has shaped who he is, instilling values of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. He is now incredibly
        excited to continue sharing his love for the sport with his two boys, nurturing their passion for hockey as they
        grow and looks forward to seeing them fall in love with the sport he holds so dear.</p>
